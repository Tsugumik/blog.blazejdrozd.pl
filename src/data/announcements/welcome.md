Welcome to my corner of the terminal.

This is where I share code, personal thoughts, and moments from everyday life.  
From development logs and tools I’m building, to reflections that go beyond code — it all belongs here.

It’s a mix of bits, emotions, and everything in between.  
Feel free to poke around.  
You’re always welcome here.
