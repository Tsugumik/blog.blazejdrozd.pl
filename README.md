Terminal Blog 🖥️

A minimal, terminal-style blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), designed to feel like you're reading in a CLI environment.

## 📝 What is this?

This is my personal space on the web where I share:
- Code snippets and tools I build
- Thoughts and personal reflections
- Small dev logs and experimental ideas

It's intentionally minimal — text-focused and clean.

## 🌐 Deployment

This website is deployed using **Cloudflare Workers**
as a serverless, edge-hosted static site, allowing for ultra-fast, globally distributed delivery.

## 🚀 Tech stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) — fast static site generator
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — for utility-first styling
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) — posts are written in plain Markdown
